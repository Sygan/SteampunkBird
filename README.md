## About

Steampunk Bird is an example game project that I have created to showcase a complete, simple game project for the students of my Game Development course. 

As this course is aimed towards teaching the very basics of Game Development the project's code is trying to be as simple as possible. There are no ads or microtransactions included. The code is thoroughly commented and I've tried to keep it as simple as possible. You can use this project and the game assets I've created however you want, just remember to credit me in your work.
